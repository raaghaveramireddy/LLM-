3. Description
In this project, 
A Huffman Tree is designed and employed with the aid of Huffman Coding by using the min-heap structure. 
This is a greedy strategy where by all data has to be compressed but in the most efficient method allowing for its recreation fully. 
It makes it possible to compress since a unique code is generated against each letter depending on frequency that every letter occurs in the data.


4. Getting Started
The graphviz and heapq are Python libraries and they come with Python 3.x installation.
- These are the operating systems: Linux, macOS, or Windows

5. Installing
to install Graphviz use pip install graphviz.

6. Executing program
Colab link : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QpFk-V-VJZU7BAKsmlBe_rXpTHUgEQYj?usp=sharing
How to run the program
*The Program Being Executed
*Firstly, open Google Colab.
*Second, we embed paste the Huffman Coding Tree into a code cell.
*3. Put the code into action.
we will be given the opportunity to insert character-frequency pairs, such as the following: [A 5, a 7, B 9, C 12] etc.
*4. The Huffman Tree will be depicted by the application and the Huffman codes for a given character will also be displayed.
The Huffman Tree will be stored under the file name `compact_huffman_tree.binâ€™, and will be kept.
